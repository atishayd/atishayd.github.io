      <h3>Ernst & Young</h3>
      <h3>Cybersecurity Intern (Incident Response)</h3>
      <h3>May - August 2024</h3>
      <hr class="separator">

      <p class="body">I was deeply involved in two international <span class="highlight">ransomware investigations</span>, where I applied advanced forensic tools such as <span class="highlight">Axiom Magnet</span> and <span class="highlight">X-Ways</span> to track the movements of the attackers and reconstruct their activities. By analyzing <span class="highlight">bash scripts</span>, <span class="highlight">metadata</span>, and files, I helped piece together the incident timeline, producing executive-ready reports that informed the strategy for mitigating future risks.</p>

      <p class="body">A significant part of my role involved investigating sensitive <span class="highlight">PII</span> from leaked documents. Working closely with cross-functional teams, I crafted <span class="highlight">SQL queries</span> to trace the movement of data across networks, identifying vulnerabilities and critical exposure points. Based on my findings, we implemented <span class="highlight">data protection</span> and <span class="highlight">encryption strategies</span> that substantially reduced data loss risks.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="body">I also created and demonstrated <span class="highlight">Rubber Ducky payloads</span> to simulate complex <span class="highlight">cyber-attacks</span>, including remote access and keystroke reflection. These demonstrations were part of a broader <span class="highlight">cybersecurity awareness</span> initiative aimed at educating employees about the risks associated with physical security breaches, especially <span class="highlight">USB-based automation attacks</span>. The hands-on experience helped reinforce the importance of <span class="highlight">preventive measures</span> and strengthening incident response protocols.</p>

      <h3>Ernst & Young</h3>
      <h3>Cybersecurity Consulting Intern</h3>
      <h3>May - August 2023</h3>
      <hr class="separator">

      <p class="body">One of the key projects I worked on involved developing a <span class="highlight">Python-based Nmap compiler</span> to automate the processing of Nmap scan results. Using <span class="highlight">Pandas</span> and <span class="highlight">Scapy</span>, I helped filter and categorize open ports, services, and protocols, providing clearer and more actionable insights for our <span class="highlight">cybersecurity teams</span>. This tool made the process of identifying vulnerabilities across networks more efficient and precise.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="body">I also participated in weekly client meetings, providing updates on <span class="highlight">vulnerability findings</span> and helping clients understand the risks identified during Nmap scans. To make these insights more accessible, I used <span class="highlight">Alteryx</span> to automate data processing and then created <span class="highlight">Power BI visualizations</span> that highlighted critical security issues, such as high-risk <span class="highlight">ports</span> and <span class="highlight">protocols</span>.</p>

      <p class="body">In addition to client-facing tasks, I contributed to enhancing the security resilience of our clients' networks by assisting in the deployment of <span class="highlight">data protection solutions</span> across multiple environments, strengthening the overall <span class="highlight">cybersecurity posture</span> of their systems.</p>

  <h3>Teaching Assistant</h3>
  <h3>Accelerated Programming in Python</h3>
  <h3>USC Viterbi School of Engineering</h3>
  <hr class="separator">

  <p class="body">In my role as a Teaching Assistant, I supported over 150 students in mastering the fundamentals of <span class="highlight">data structures</span> and <span class="highlight">algorithms</span>. I was responsible for grading exams and assignments, holding <span class="highlight">office hours</span>, and providing one-on-one guidance to students who needed extra help. My focus was on helping students strengthen their understanding of programming concepts and solving coding challenges efficiently.</p>
